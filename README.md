# Rhode Island Election Shapefile
This shapefile was obtained from the Rhode Island GIS Data Distribution System and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG). 

## Sources
The precinct, congressional, state house, and state senate district shapefiles come from the Rhode Island Department of State through the [Rhode Island GIS Data Distribution System](http://www.rigis.org). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile for Rhode Island was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). Election data were downloaded from the [Rhode Island Board of Elections](http://www.elections.ri.gov/elections/preresults/). 

## Processing
Election data from the RI Board of Elections were cleaned by MGGG staff to join it to the precinct shapefile. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level to precincts using [MGGG’s proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup). Congressional, house, and senate district IDs were assigned to precincts also using this package.
